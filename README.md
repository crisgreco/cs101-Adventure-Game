Welcome to the Adventure Game!
In this game there are 5 levels. Each level has 3 rooms, inside each there's a dangerous animal.
Before every level you will choose if you want to use a power up.
You have 3 power ups that you can use throughout the game:
1. Health boost: gives you 25% more health.
2. Super agility: increases the chances that the animal will miss its attack by 25%.
3. Extra damage: gives you 25% extra damage on all your weapons.
You will only be able to use one power up per level.
Then you will choose which room and animal to fight.
You will start out with a rock as your weapon.
Each time you attack the animal you will use a random item from your inventory.
When the animal attacks you, there's a 50% that it misses.
When you complete a level you will get a new weapon.
If you kill all the animals you win!
